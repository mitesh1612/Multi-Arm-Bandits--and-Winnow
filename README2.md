# Multi Arm Bandit Algorithms and Winnow's Algorithm

Implemented various multi arm bandit algorithms and compared them for various 2 arm bandit problems. 

Algorithms like UCB, EXP3, Epsilon Greedy were implemented. 

Also implemented Winnow Algorithm for classification and compared its accuracy with Perceptron on classification for 2 different datasets : Email Spam Data and SMS Spam Data.

The Email Spam data is already given in processed form and thus was used directly.

The SMS Spam data was in sentences form and thus basic word processing like tokenization, stop word removal, stemming etc were done and then a Bag of Words Model was created.
